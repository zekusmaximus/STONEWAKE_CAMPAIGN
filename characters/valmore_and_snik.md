# Valmore & Snik - Companion Sheet (Canon)
*DM-controlled companion(s). Designed to be pasted into a fresh chat to restore full mechanical state.*

> **Control Policy:** The DM runs Valmore and Snik like NPCs/companions: full tactical agency, initiative-separated, resources tracked. The player never chooses their actions.
