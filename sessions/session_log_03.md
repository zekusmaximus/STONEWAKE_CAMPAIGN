# Session Log 03

## Date Anchor
Night Day 2 -> Dawn Day 3 (Brindlecross authority; watchtower strike)

## Party
- Baron Luno (approaching Paladin 3 during this arc)

## Summary (Detailed)
- Baron Luno debriefed with **Captain Arveth Kain** and **Lieutenant Sera Vonn** at Brindlecross garrison.
- Brindlecross issued:
  - **Writ of Road Authority**
  - **Healing potions**
  - Access to intelligence about likely staging sites (watchtower, Black Post, old spur roads)
- Luno chose a **night operation** rather than resting, seeking to exploit the disruption window before the enemy repositioned.
- He infiltrated an **abandoned watchtower** used as a forward command post and attempted a silent sentry elimination.
- Initial strike wounded but failed to drop a sentry, triggering alert escalation.
- Luno used a decisive **Divine Smite** to kill the alarm-bearing sentry at the doorway, preventing full mobilization.
- He disengaged and withdrew cleanly, refusing a prolonged 1v4+ stand-up fight.
- Brindlecross assessed the strike as "exactly enough" and adjusted patrols accordingly.

## Mechanical Notes
- Key resource expenditure: 1 spell slot used for Divine Smite to prevent alarm.
- Tactical success depended on prioritizing alarm denial and disengagement.

## World State Changes
- Watchtower forward post compromised; enemy became defensive and repositioned.
- Brindlecross gained time and confidence in irregular tactics.

## Open Threads Created
- Enemy command relocated; likely staging from less obvious civilian-facing hubs.
- Next step: identify the sponsor paying for interdiction.
