# Session Log 04

## Date Anchor
Day 3 -> Day 4 (Harrowfen Mill surveillance and ledger sabotage)

## Party
- Baron Luno (Paladin 3; Oath of Vengeance selection occurred during this arc)

## Summary (Detailed)
- Luno shifted from tactical raids to counter-network strategy: **follow the sponsor** rather than fight hobgoblins directly.
- He tailed a column containing hobgoblin screen troops, two human mercenaries, and a cloaked civilian sponsor.
- Sponsor separated from hobgoblins and traveled to **Harrowfen Mill**, a discreet safehouse with professional guard rotations.
- Luno conducted night surveillance and observed:
  - A second wagon arriving from the north
  - A **custom merchant seal** consistent with a river consortium (non-local capital)
  - Sponsor behavior consistent with a contractor node, not a principal financier
- Instead of violence, Luno executed a surgical **paper trail sabotage**:
  - Seal mismatch
  - Ledger offset
  - Route ambiguity notation
  - Removal of a receipt stub needed for payment release
- He withdrew undetected and briefed Brindlecross quietly, enabling lawful pressure without revealing his hand.

## Mechanical Notes
- Operation prioritized stealth and Investigation/Insight over combat.
- Resulted in major XP gains through objective completion without escalation.

## World State Changes
- Hobgoblin contracts destabilized via delayed/failed payments.
- Consortium structure identified: violence as outsourced tool of economic coercion.
- Brindlecross positioned to exploit the collapse via audits and impoundments.

## Open Threads Created
- Replacement contractor likely to be dispatched to "fix accounts."
- Higher-tier coordinators would surface when shipment timelines approached.
