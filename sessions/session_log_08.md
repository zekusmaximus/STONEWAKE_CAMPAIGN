## Date Anchor
Day 20+ (Grayhaven response and road audit escalation)

## Party
- Baron Luno (Paladin 5)
- Valmore (Fighter 5, EK)
- Snik (Kobold scout NPC)

## Summary (Detailed)
- Luno briefed Deputy Chancellor Merrow on Ashfall's delegated arbitration and secured broadened audit authority.
- En route to Brindlecross, Luno scouted Redwillow Crossing and a Stonewake Road toll node, noting a parallel supplemental ledger.
- Captain Kain accepted the authorization letter and agreed to a controlled audit timed to a rider's visit.
- The audit detained the rider, seized/copied the supplemental ledger, and revealed ties to Asset Resolution Partners.
- Luno extracted intel: ARP handler operates in Grayhaven under a sealed identity (marker GRH-E/13) with a mid-afternoon courier window.
- Returning to Grayhaven, Luno engaged and cleared a hobgoblin splinter band; collected 18 sp and 7 cp.

## Mechanical Notes
- Ashfall Escalation advanced to 3/6 after the supplemental ledger seizure.
- Combat: 5 hobgoblin splinters defeated; no PC resource expenditure.

## World State Changes

- Decide whether to strike via controlled audit or quiet surveillance.
