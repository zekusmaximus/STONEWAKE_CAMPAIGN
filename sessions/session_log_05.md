# Session Log 05

## Date Anchor
Day 5 (River Spur Road interception; asset flipped)

## Party
- Baron Luno (Paladin 4 achieved during/after this operation)

## Summary (Detailed)
- Brindlecross intelligence confirmed a **replacement contractor** en route, posing as a grain assessor with two mercenary escorts.
- Luno chose a fast decapitation tactic: **Vow of Enmity** on the crossbow mercenary and immediate lethal strike to remove ranged threat.
- He killed Mercenary 1 in one exchange using melee + smite-level burst.
- He then pursued and **grappled** the contractor alive rather than killing him, preserving intelligence value.
- The remaining mercenary fled rather than die for an employer.
- Luno used **deal-making** rather than intimidation:
  - Framed contractor as disposable
  - Offered protection and a path to survive
  - Turned him into an internal asset tasked to report partial failure and feed names/schedules upward

## Mechanical Notes
- Channel Divinity used (Vow of Enmity).
- Spell slot used for burst damage (as canon).
- XP awarded pushed Luno to Level 4; Level 4 ASI later applied (+2 STR).

## World State Changes
- An internal asset now existed inside consortium logistics.
- The "next shipment" timeline became a measurable leverage point.
- Consortium leadership expected the issue to be containable, lowering guard.

## Open Threads Created
- Regional coordinator would intervene if next shipment threatened.
- Meeting and exposure opportunities in Redwillow Crossing increased.
