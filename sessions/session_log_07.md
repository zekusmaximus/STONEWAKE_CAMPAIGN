# Session Log 07

## Date Anchor
Day 20+ (Grayhaven political fallout; Ashfall Exchange infiltration; party restructuring)

## Party
- Baron Luno (Paladin 5 applied in canon; HP corrected to 41)
- Companions added in project phase: Valmore and Snik (DM-controlled)

## Summary (Detailed)
- Grayhaven officials (Deputy Chancellor Merrow) recognized trade pressure was shifting from violence to predatory legal infrastructure.
- Infernal notary marks and "stabilization charter" language indicated an external systemic actor.
- Luno infiltrated **Ashfall Exchange**, an infernal-backed escrow and arbitration house.
- He requested arbitration authority access; Ashfall revealed a critical structure:
  - Arbitration authority is **delegated**, not centralized.
  - Enforcement is subcontracted to **Asset Resolution Partners**.
  - Appeals escalate to a non-local guarantor.
- This confirmed the campaign's next-tier threat: a stakeholder powerful enough to underwrite "stability" through contracts-dragon-class behavior.
- Campaign paused to build a durable Project for context resets and to formalize companions:
  - Valmore (EK fighter) and Snik (kobold scout) replace earlier companion concept.

## Mechanical Notes
- Baron Luno is locked at Paladin 5, Oath of Vengeance, STR 19, HP 41.
- Project files created to preserve state across context resets.

## World State Changes
- Ashfall now classifies Luno as a "Regulatory Actor," initiating surveillance/containment clock.
- Dragon intervention clock increased due to exposure of delegated enforcement structure.

## Open Threads Created
- Identify Asset Resolution Partners (leaders, locations, methods).
- Identify non-local guarantor (dragon or equivalent).
- Decide whether to attack Ashfall legally, militarily via proxies, or via political coalition.
