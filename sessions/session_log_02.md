# Session Log 02

## Date Anchor
Day 2 (Stonewake Road -> Ravine -> continuing to Brindlecross)

## Party
- Baron Luno (Paladin 1)

## Summary (Detailed)
- Baron Luno chose a cautious pursuit of the hobgoblins' blood trail, prioritizing intelligence and caravan safety.
- He successfully **remained hidden** and observed a small hobgoblin element:
  - A disciplined sergeant-type leader
  - A lightly armored **runner** preparing to carry a report north-northeast
  - Two additional soldiers, one wounded (likely from the ambush)
- Luno correctly assessed that the **runner** was the highest-value target (message delivery would escalate the threat).
- He executed a **ranged interdiction** (javelin) that severely wounded and slowed the runner, preventing immediate departure.
- He chose to withdraw immediately rather than overextend into a sustained fight, preserving mission success and denying the enemy clarity on his position and numbers.
- The caravan reached **Brindlecross** at sunset without further attack.

## Mechanical Notes
- Runner interdiction achieved without committing to a losing 1v4+ engagement.
- XP advanced toward early leveling (campaign canon reached Level 3 soon after subsequent events).

## World State Changes
- Hobgoblin forward screen disrupted; enemy tempo slowed.
- Brindlecross alerted to road interdiction pattern.
- Baron Luno arrives as a credible irregular asset.

## Open Threads Created
- Main hobgoblin force likely north-northeast; forward screen indicates a larger plan.
- Enemy now aware a skilled defender is present on the road.
