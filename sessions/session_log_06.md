# Session Log 06

## Date Anchor
Day 7 (Redwillow Crossing arrest; node decapitation)

## Party
- Baron Luno (Paladin 4 -> Level 5 eligibility reached later)
- Brindlecross plain-tabard guards and magistrate clerk (support assets)

## Summary (Detailed)
- Using Luno's Writ of Road Authority and Brindlecross legal scaffolding, a public-facing but controlled operation was staged in **Redwillow Crossing**.
- The target: the regional coordinator (name redacted in canon) operating the consortium's local scheme.
- The arrest took place in a riverfront counting house with witnesses, intentionally framed as routine trade enforcement.
- Luno asserted authority decisively; bodyguards evaluated odds and stood down without violence.
- Ledgers and cargo were seized and impounded; coordinator detained.
- Result: the regional node collapsed without open battle; hobgoblin proxy contracts rapidly degraded.

## Mechanical Notes
- No combat occurred; success was achieved via authority and social dominance.
- XP gain made Baron Luno Level 5 eligible soon after.

## World State Changes
- River consortium fractured at regional tier; higher-tier players now incentivized to step in.
- Redwillow merchants became nervous; Grayhaven trade politics destabilized.

## Open Threads Created
- A larger guarantor likely existed above coordinator level.
- A "trade stabilization" narrative became likely to fill the vacuum.
