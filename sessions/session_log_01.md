# Session Log 01

## Date Anchor
Day 1 -> Day 2 (Stonewake Road, departing Grayhaven)

## Party
- Baron Luno (Paladin 1 at session start)

## Summary (Detailed)
- Baron Luno accepted an escort contract to protect a trade caravan leaving Grayhaven for Brindlecross along the Stonewake Road.
- The caravan was led by **Caravan Master Hale**, with several guards and multiple wagons.
- Mid-route, disciplined **hobgoblin** forces executed an ambush from cover, attempting to pin the caravan in a kill zone.
- Baron Luno held the line with shield and longsword, leveraging **AC 18** and Protection style positioning to mitigate incoming damage.
- The ambush was repelled; evidence (discipline, formation, and intent) suggested this was not random banditry but a coordinated interdiction screen.
- After the skirmish, Baron Luno identified a **blood trail** indicating wounded hobgoblins withdrew northward, implying a nearby command element.

## Mechanical Notes
- Baron Luno survived without expending long-rest resources in a way that compromised mission completion.
- Immediate post-fight state: caravan intact; threat assessed as escalating.

## World State Changes
- Stonewake Road confirmed contested by organized hobgoblins.
- Baron Luno now recognized by caravan personnel as a decisive defender.

## Open Threads Created
- Wounded hobgoblins withdrew toward a northern ravine and likely a command node.
- Question introduced: who is paying hobgoblins to disrupt trade?
