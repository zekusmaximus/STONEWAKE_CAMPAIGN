# World State - Stonewake Campaign (Canon, Detailed)
*This document is meant to be "drop-in context" for new chats. It contains timeline, locations, NPC rosters, faction motives, and current strategic situation. Update it only when facts change.*

## Campaign Premise (One Paragraph)
The Stonewake Road between **Grayhaven** and **Brindlecross** was destabilized by disciplined **hobgoblin interdiction**, later revealed to be a deniable enforcement layer supporting an economic power-play by a **river consortium**. Baron Luno (Tiefling Paladin, Oath of Vengeance) shifted the conflict from skirmishes into counter-network warfare: interdiction, sabotage of ledgers and seals, and lawful arrests that decapitated the regional node. This vacuum drew in an infernal-backed escrow house-**Ashfall Exchange**-which offers "trade stabilization" through contracts, arbitration, and subcontracted enforcement. The structure strongly suggests a larger patron (dragon-class stakeholder) behind the escrow model.

## Canon Timeline (Days are approximate anchors)
### Day 1-2: Road War Begins
- Baron Luno escorts a caravan from **Grayhaven** along Stonewake Road.
- Hobgoblin ambush attempt is defeated; evidence suggests a larger, disciplined force.
- Luno interdicts a hobgoblin runner (wounded, message delayed), then withdraws.
- Caravan arrives at **Brindlecross** intact; Luno receives a **Writ of Road Authority** and support (healing potions).

### Day 2-3: Forward Command Disruption
- Night operation against an abandoned watchtower used as a forward post.
- Luno kills a sentry with **Divine Smite**, prevents full alarm, disengages cleanly.
- Hobgoblins adapt: consolidate, reposition, stop chasing into darkness.

### Day 3-4: Sponsor Identified; Economics Poisoned
- Luno shadows a cloaked sponsor escorted by hobgoblins and human mercenaries.
- Sponsor splits from hobgoblins; leads to **Harrowfen Mill** (safehouse).
- Luno conducts surveillance, identifies second wagon and a **non-local consortium seal**.
- Luno sabotages ledger/seals to force downstream audit failures without triggering immediate violence.

### Day 4-7: Node Decapitation
- Replacement contractor dispatched; Luno intercepts, captures, and flips him as an asset.
- Brindlecross stages a lawful arrest in **Redwillow Crossing**, seizing ledgers/cargo and detaining the regional coordinator.
- The "road war" ends quietly; the conflict shifts into trade-law, arbitration, and hidden enforcement.

### Day 20+: Ashfall Exchange Enters the Board
- Grayhaven leadership detects infernal notary marks and predatory "trade stabilization" charters.
- Luno infiltrates **Ashfall Exchange** and obtains redacted arbitration framework: enforcement is subcontracted to **Asset Resolution Partners**, with appeals to a non-local guarantor.
- Luno coordinates a controlled audit at a Stonewake Road toll node; a supplemental ledger is seized and a rider confirms **Asset Resolution Partners** report to a sealed Grayhaven handler (marker **GRH-E/13**).

## Named NPC Roster (Canonical)
### Brindlecross
- **Captain Arveth Kain** - garrison commander; pragmatic; favors irregular action with plausible deniability.
- **Lieutenant Sera Vonn** - logistics/intelligence; map-minded; built the trap architecture.
- **(Unnamed scribes/clerks)** - administrative support.

### Grayhaven
- **Deputy Chancellor Merrow** - bureaucratic power broker; manages trade panic; prefers "correct paperwork" over heroics.
- **Magistrate Elen Vos** - trade-law specialist; quietly tips Luno about audits, flight risk, and legal traps.
- **Senior Archivist (Temple Annex)** - unnamed; revealed Luno's lineage is "directed" toward contract enforcement archetypes.

### Adversarial / Ambiguous
- **Senior Factor Caldris** - Ashfall Exchange senior representative; professional; probing Luno as a constraint.
- **Infernal Adjunct (unnamed)** - human-presenting infernal agent; categorizes rather than threatens; stated: "Arbitration authority is delegated."
- **Regional Coordinator (name redacted by Brindlecross)** - detained; node operator for consortium; used mercenaries and cutouts.
- **Replacement Contractor (flipped asset; unnamed)** - accountant-operator cutout; returned to feed intel upward.

## Factions & Motives
### River Consortium (Regional Trade Capital)
- **Public face:** shipping and river logistics.
- **Actual behavior:** uses deniable violence (hobgoblins) + cutouts (contractors) to make trade routes dependent, then offer "solutions."
- **Current status:** fractured regionally after the coordinator's arrest; likely regrouping at a higher tier.

### Hobgoblin Screen Elements
- **Role:** forward interdiction, harassment, disruption, courier denial.
- **Motivation:** paid late on purpose -> desperation.
- **Current status:** leaderless/unpaid; risk of splinter violence.

### Ashfall Exchange (Infernal Escrow)
- **Public face:** neutral escrow, guaranteed performance, arbitration.
- **Mechanism:** contracts centralize dispute resolution; enforcement outsourced to **Asset Resolution Partners**.
- **Strategic goal:** privatize governance functions (security and adjudication) under "market stability."
- **Current status:** classified Luno as "Regulatory Actor." Watching.

### Brindlecross Garrison
- **Goal:** keep the road open; win without open war; preserve legitimacy.
- **Method:** patrols + audits + targeted detentions + plausible deniability.

### Grayhaven Government
- **Goal:** avoid collapse of trade; avoid admitting weakness.
- **Method:** administrative enforcement, temple archives, quiet alliances.

## Magical/Metaphysical Notes (Canon)
### Infernal Recognition (Luno)
- Luno's Abyssal tiefling heritage presents as **directed** rather than chaotic: a lineage associated with contract enforcement archetypes (arbiter/executioner). In infernal-adjacent contexts, Luno can read "bad faith" structures unusually well.

---

## Current Situation Snapshot (Use this to restart sessions)
- The **regional coordinator** is detained; ledgers seized; cargo impounded.
- The **river consortium** is destabilized regionally but not destroyed.
- **Ashfall Exchange** is the emerging systemic threat: legal capture through arbitration and escrow.
- Enforcement is **delegated** to **Asset Resolution Partners**, pointing to a non-local guarantor.
- A supplemental ledger seized at a **Stonewake Road toll node** indicates a parallel fee structure and a sealed Grayhaven handler (**GRH-E/13**).
- A **dragon-scale patron** is suspected but not yet revealed; the campaign is positioned for a dragon that behaves like a financier/monopoly enforcer rather than a random monster.

---

## Immediate Open Threads
- Who is the non-local guarantor behind Ashfall's delegated enforcement?
- Where do the Asset Resolution Partners operate (hq, leaders, recruitment)?
- Who is the Grayhaven handler using the **GRH-E/13** marker?
- Will unpaid hobgoblin remnants become a new destabilizing force?
- How will Grayhaven and Brindlecross respond to "trade stabilization" charters that are technically legal?

---

## Canon Tone Notes (for new chats)
- Tactical realism: ambushes, chokepoints, discipline, pursuit, disengage.
- Economics as warfare: ledgers, seals, arbitration, impoundment, audits.
- Supernatural as bureaucracy: infernal influence manifests as contracts, not pentagrams.
- Dragon foreshadowing: as a stakeholder enforcing monopoly and "stability," not a random cave boss.
