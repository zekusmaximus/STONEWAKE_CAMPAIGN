# Active Clocks - Stonewake Campaign (Canon)
*Clocks are tracked to preserve tension and pacing across chat resets. Each clock has: what it measures, what advances it, what happens at each threshold, and how it can be reduced or redirected.*

---

## How to Use Clocks
- **Advance** clocks when player actions logically increase pressure or when time passes and adversaries act.
- **Tick size:** usually +1 for a major scene consequence, +2 for a major public disruption.
- **Resolve** clocks when their outcome triggers and replaces the clock with a new state.
- **Reduce** clocks via specific counter-actions (listed per clock). Most clocks cannot be reduced by "waiting."

## Clock 1 - Ashfall Escalation (Current: 3/6)
### What it Measures
Ashfall Exchange's institutional response to Baron Luno as a constraint (surveillance, legal pressure, proxy enforcement, recruitment attempts).

### What Advances It
- Luno obtains internal docs / exposes arbitration structure (+1)
- Luno arrests or impounds assets tied to Ashfall clients (+1)
- Public scandal involving Ashfall brand (+2)
- Direct violence inside Ashfall-controlled spaces (+2)

### Threshold Outcomes
- **1/6 - Awareness:** Ashfall tags Luno as a variable. *(already happened)*
- **2/6 - Classification:** "Regulatory Actor" label; passive surveillance begins.
- **3/6 - Soft Containment:** legal harassment, subpoenas, charter challenges, reputational pressure. *(current)*
- **4/6 - Proxy Enforcement:** Asset Resolution Partners deployed to test and measure Luno.
- **5/6 - Offer or Ultimatum:** Ashfall attempts to bind Luno via contract or make him persona non grata.
- **6/6 - Hard Response:** coordinated proxy action + political pressure; open conflict becomes difficult to avoid.

### How to Reduce / Redirect
- Feed Ashfall controlled misinformation (successful deception operations)
- Shift public blame onto consortium rivals (political scapegoating)
- Secure a superior patron/protection arrangement (rare; replaces the clock)

## Clock 2 - Dragon Intervention Threshold (Current: 1/6)
### What it Measures
How close the campaign is to explicit dragon involvement as a stakeholder/patron.

### What Advances It
- Disrupting major trade flows (+1)
- Exposing delegated enforcement structures (+1)
- Killing or capturing high-value proxies (+1)
- Threatening "stability" narratives publicly (+2)

### Threshold Outcomes
- **1/6 - Foreshadow:** signs of non-local guarantor; unusual seals, impossible credit lines. *(current)*
- **2/6 - Indirect Touch:** dragon's agents appear (lawyers, mercenaries, cult-adjacent accountants).
- **3/6 - Policy Pressure:** towns offered "stability contracts" with coercive terms.
- **4/6 - Asset Test:** a proxy strike team with dragon-backed indemnity challenges the party.
- **5/6 - Direct Message:** dragon communicates via emissary, contract, or dreamlike threat.
- **6/6 - Dragon on the Board:** explicit presence (good/bad) and a hard stake in the region.

### How to Reduce / Redirect
- Convince the dragon the region is not worth direct attention (rare)
- Provide the dragon a better target/return elsewhere (dangerous)
- Ally with the dragon (changes the campaign; resolves the clock into a new alliance clock)

## Clock 3 - Hobgoblin Fragmentation (Current: 3/6)
### What it Measures
What unpaid/leaderless hobgoblin remnants become: bandits, warband, hired proxies, or desperate refugees.

### What Advances It
- Time passes without payment (+1 per week)
- Leadership removed (+1) *(already occurred)*
- External sponsor offers new contract (+1)
- Party kills their remaining leaders (+1)

### Threshold Outcomes
- **1/6 - Restlessness:** discipline slips.
- **2/6 - Desertion:** small groups peel away.
- **3/6 - Predation:** splinters raid soft targets. *(current)*
- **4/6 - Warband:** a new charismatic leader forms a concentrated threat.
- **5/6 - Brutal Example:** massacre or arson forces political reaction.
- **6/6 - New Faction:** hobgoblins become either a persistent regional scourge or a formal proxy army under a new patron.

### How to Reduce / Redirect
- Offer amnesty and structure (risky diplomacy)
- Hunt and remove the emerging new leader before 4/6
- Cut off weapon supplies and food routes (logistics war)

---

## Clock 4 - Grayhaven Political Stability (Current: 2/6)
### What it Measures
Internal stress in Grayhaven as trade models shift: panic, corruption, factionalism.

### Advances It
- Price spikes / shortages (+1)
- Public violence on the road (+1)
- Ashfall charters gain signatories (+1)
- Scandal involving officials (+2)

### Threshold Outcomes (high-level)
- 3/6: emergency council measures
- 4/6: rival factions weaponize the crisis
- 5/6: crackdown or coup-like maneuver
- 6/6: civil fracture (campaign-wide consequences)

### Reduce / Redirect
- Stabilize trade without Ashfall
- Provide political wins (legal arrests, recovered shipments)
- Expose external manipulation early

---

## Clock 5 - Brindlecross Legitimacy (Current: 1/6)
### What it Measures
Whether Brindlecross can keep winning quietly without looking like it's becoming the thing it fights.

### Advances It
- Use of irregular violence with witnesses (+1-2)
- Overreach arrests (+1)
- Evidence of "political policing" (+2)

### Outcomes
- 3/6: public oversight hearings / demands
- 4/6: reduced cooperation from towns
- 6/6: legitimacy crisis; Ashfall gains an opening

### Reduce
- Maintain clean paper trails
- Use magistrate oversight
- Publicize lawful wins selectively
