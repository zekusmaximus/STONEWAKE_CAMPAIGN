# Factions and Motives (Canon, Mirror)
This file mirrors the factions section from `world/world_state.md` for quick access. Keep both in sync.

## River Consortium (Regional Trade Capital)
- **Public face:** shipping and river logistics.
- **Actual behavior:** uses deniable violence (hobgoblins) + cutouts (contractors) to make trade routes dependent, then offer "solutions."
- **Current status:** fractured regionally after the coordinator's arrest; likely regrouping at a higher tier.

## Hobgoblin Screen Elements
- **Role:** forward interdiction, harassment, disruption, courier denial.
- **Motivation:** paid late on purpose + desperation.
- **Current status:** leaderless/unpaid; risk of splinter violence.

## Ashfall Exchange (Infernal Escrow)
- **Public face:** neutral escrow, guaranteed performance, arbitration.
- **Mechanism:** contracts centralize dispute resolution; enforcement outsourced to **Asset Resolution Partners**.
- **Strategic goal:** privatize governance functions (security and adjudication) under "market stability."
- **Current status:** classified Luno as "Regulatory Actor." Watching.

## Brindlecross Garrison
- **Goal:** keep the road open; win without open war; preserve legitimacy.
- **Method:** patrols + audits + targeted detentions + plausible deniability.

## Grayhaven Government
- **Goal:** avoid collapse of trade; avoid admitting weakness.
- **Method:** administrative enforcement, temple archives, quiet alliances.
