# Rules Assumptions (RAW Baseline)
This file records rule-set assumptions to avoid drift across sessions.

## Core assumption
- D&D 5e RAW applies. When unclear, document rulings in Errata.

## Edition baseline
- The campaign currently references 2024 PHB updates when previously stated in canon.
- If a rule differs between 2014 and 2024, use the version already applied in canon.
- If no canon reference exists, pick one version and record the choice in Errata.
