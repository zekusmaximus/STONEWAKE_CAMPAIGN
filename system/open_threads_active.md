# Open Threads - Active (Canon, Session 07+)

*This file tracks current active threads, priority order for NPC actions, and what requires player input vs. what advances independently. Update after each session.*

---

## Immediate Threats (Require Player Action Soon)

### Thread 1: Ashfall Surveillance & Classification
**Status:** Active; Clock 1 (Ashfall Escalation) at 2/6

**What's Happening:**
- Ashfall Exchange has classified Luno as "Regulatory Actor"
- Passive surveillance is active (observers, informants, contract network)
- Next threshold (3/6) triggers soft containment (legal harassment, subpoenas, charter challenges)

**What Advances It:**
- Luno exposing more Ashfall operations (+1)
- Luno arresting/impounding Ashfall client assets (+1)
- Public scandal involving Ashfall (+2)
- Direct violence in Ashfall spaces (+2)

**Player Decisions Required:**
- How to respond to Ashfall classification (ignore, counter-surveil, preempt escalation)
- Whether to continue disrupting Ashfall clients or shift tactics
- Whether to seek legal protection (magistrate, writs) or political allies

**NPC Actions (Independent):**
- Caldris will continue classification observations
- Ashfall will offer "stability contracts" to Grayhaven merchants
- Asset Resolution Partners may begin positioning assets regionally

---

### Thread 2: Detained Regional Coordinator (Interrogation Opportunity)
**Status:** Active; asset in Brindlecross custody

**What's Happening:**
- Regional coordinator detained in Brindlecross garrison
- Coordinator fears Hellsbind contract activation → motivated to cooperate
- Has intel on: consortium structure, Asset Resolution Partners, contract mechanisms
- May be stalling for external rescue or ransom

**What Advances It:**
- Time passing (rescue attempts become more likely)
- Luno interrogating directly (player gets intel, but risks clock advancement)
- Ashfall discovering detention location (triggers rescue operation or elimination)

**Player Decisions Required:**
- Whether to interrogate personally or delegate to Brindlecross
- What specific intel to prioritize (ARP structure, guarantor identity, contract vulnerabilities)
- Whether to offer protection deal or use pure intimidation
- Whether to publicize arrest or keep it quiet

**NPC Actions (Independent):**
- Brindlecross continues secure detention
- Coordinator may leak partial intel to buy time
- Ashfall may deploy legal pressure or proxies for extraction

---

### Thread 3: Hobgoblin Fragmentation (Escalating Regional Threat)
**Status:** Active; Clock 3 (Hobgoblin Fragmentation) at 3/6

**What's Happening:**
- Unpaid hobgoblin remnants are raiding soft targets (farms, travelers)
- Leadership removed; discipline slipping toward banditry
- Next threshold (4/6) triggers warband consolidation under new leader
- Becoming Grayhaven/Brindlecross political problem

**What Advances It:**
- Time passing without payment (+1 per week)
- External sponsor offering new contract (+1)
- Party killing remaining leaders (+1)

**Player Decisions Required:**
- Whether to hunt remaining leaders preemptively (prevents warband formation)
- Whether to offer amnesty/structure (risky diplomacy)
- Whether to prioritize hobgoblins vs. Ashfall operations

**NPC Actions (Independent):**
- Hobgoblin raids will increase in frequency and boldness
- Potential new leader may emerge within 1-2 weeks
- Ashfall or other factions may attempt recruitment
- Grayhaven/Brindlecross will pressure Luno for resolution

---

## Medium-Term Threats (Active but Not Urgent)

### Thread 4: Asset Resolution Partners (Proxy Enforcement Network)
**Status:** Identified but not engaged

**What's Happening:**
- ARP is Ashfall's enforcement arm (legal repossessions, contract enforcement, mercenary violence)
- Structure unknown (leaders, locations, methods, legal cover)
- Will deploy if Ashfall Escalation clock reaches 4/6
- Operates with plausible deniability and jurisdictional maneuvering

**What Advances It:**
- Ashfall Escalation clock advancement
- Luno disrupting more Ashfall operations
- Dragon Intervention clock advancement (may increase funding/authorization)

**Player Decisions Required:**
- Whether to research ARP proactively (intel gathering, surveillance)
- Whether to preempt deployment by disrupting their infrastructure
- Whether to prepare legal defenses (jurisdiction, writs, magistrate support)

**NPC Actions (Independent):**
- ARP may begin regional reconnaissance
- Ashfall will brief ARP on Luno's capabilities and patterns
- ARP may test Luno with low-risk contract enforcement attempts

---

### Thread 5: Non-Local Guarantor Identity (Dragon-Class Stakeholder)
**Status:** Foreshadowed; Clock 2 (Dragon Intervention) at 1/6

**What's Happening:**
- Unknown dragon (or equivalent) underwrites Ashfall operations
- Provides impossible credit lines and final arbitration authority
- Currently observing from distance; not yet directly involved
- Next threshold (2/6) triggers agent appearance (lawyers, mercenaries, cultists)

**What Advances It:**
- Disrupting major trade flows (+1)
- Exposing delegated enforcement structures (+1)
- Killing/capturing high-value proxies (+1)
- Threatening "stability" narratives publicly (+2)

**Player Decisions Required:**
- Whether to research guarantor identity (archives, infernal contacts, Ashfall intel)
- Whether to avoid dragon attention or provoke early confrontation
- Whether to seek counter-patrons (churches, rival dragons, political coalitions)

**NPC Actions (Independent):**
- Dragon continues passive observation
- May deploy agents if thresholds are crossed
- May offer "stability contract" directly to Luno (binding/recruitment attempt)

---

### Thread 6: Grayhaven Political Stability (Economic Pressure)
**Status:** Active; Clock 4 (Grayhaven Stability) at 2/6

**What's Happening:**
- Grayhaven leadership anxious about trade disruption
- Ashfall offering predatory "stability contracts" to desperate merchants
- Deputy Chancellor Merrow attempting trade diversification
- Risk of merchant factions pushing for Ashfall acceptance

**What Advances It:**
- Price spikes or shortages (+1)
- Public violence on trade roads (+1)
- Ashfall charters gaining signatories (+1)
- Scandal involving Grayhaven officials (+2)

**Player Decisions Required:**
- Whether to help stabilize Grayhaven trade (escort missions, route security)
- Whether to expose Ashfall contract terms publicly
- Whether to provide political wins (arrests, recovered cargo, exposed conspiracies)

**NPC Actions (Independent):**
- Merrow will resist Ashfall but faces merchant pressure
- Magistrate Vos will continue quiet support for Luno
- Ashfall will target economically vulnerable merchants with contracts

---

## Long-Term Setup (Not Yet Active)

### Thread 7: Brindlecross Legitimacy Risk
**Status:** Monitoring; Clock 5 (Brindlecross Legitimacy) at 1/6

**What's Happening:**
- Brindlecross irregular operations (writ-based arrests, proxy actions) risk appearing like "political policing"
- So far operations have been clean and legally justified
- Risk increases if Luno uses irregular violence with witnesses

**What Advances It:**
- Irregular violence with witnesses (+1-2)
- Overreach arrests (detaining without evidence) (+1)
- Evidence of "political policing" exposed (+2)

**Player Decisions Required:**
- Whether to maintain legal cover for all operations
- Whether to accept magistrate/official oversight
- Whether to publicize lawful wins selectively (reputation management)

**NPC Actions (Independent):**
- Captain Kain will maintain clean documentation standards
- External observers (Grayhaven, Ashfall) will look for legitimacy gaps
- Ashfall may attempt to manufacture scandal

---

### Thread 8: Luno's Lineage Significance
**Status:** Foreshadowed; not yet explored

**What's Happening:**
- Temple archivist noted Luno's lineage is "directed" toward contract enforcement archetypes
- Unclear if this is prophetic, arcane, or infernal pattern
- May connect to why Ashfall is particularly interested in him

**What Advances It:**
- Luno researching his own lineage
- Ashfall revealing more about why they're monitoring him
- Temple or infernal entities explaining the significance

**Player Decisions Required:**
- Whether to pursue lineage research (temple archives, infernal contacts)
- Whether to ignore as irrelevant or treat as strategic intel

**NPC Actions (Independent):**
- Archivist may provide additional hints if Luno returns
- Ashfall may reveal lineage knowledge as leverage
- Infernal entities may attempt recruitment based on lineage

---

## Priority Order for NPC Actions (When Player is Not Directing)

### Immediate (Next Session Opening)
1. **Ashfall surveillance:** Observers track Luno's movements and associations
2. **Hobgoblin raids:** Continue small-unit raids on soft targets
3. **Coordinator detention:** Brindlecross maintains security; coordinator stalls

### Short-Term (Next 1-2 In-Game Days)
1. **Ashfall contracts:** Offer stability contracts to 2-3 Grayhaven merchants
2. **ARP reconnaissance:** Begin regional positioning if Luno disrupts more clients
3. **Hobgoblin consolidation:** Leadership vacuum may attract new commander

### Medium-Term (Next 1-2 In-Game Weeks)
1. **Dragon agent deployment:** If Clock 2 reaches 2/6
2. **Ashfall soft containment:** If Clock 1 reaches 3/6
3. **Hobgoblin warband formation:** If Clock 3 reaches 4/6
4. **Grayhaven political crisis:** If Clock 4 reaches 3/6

## What Requires Player Action vs. What Advances Independently

### Requires Player Action (Will Not Progress Without Luno)
- Interrogating detained coordinator
- Researching ARP structure
- Researching guarantor/dragon identity
- Deciding response strategy to Ashfall classification
- Hunting hobgoblin leaders preemptively
- Stabilizing Grayhaven trade routes

### Advances Independently (Clocks Tick Without Player)
- Ashfall surveillance and contract offers
- Hobgoblin fragmentation and raids
- Grayhaven economic pressure
- ARP positioning (if triggered)
- Dragon intervention (if triggered)
- Brindlecross legitimacy (affected by player actions but NPCs monitor)

## DM Agent Guidance

**At Session Start:**
- Check which clocks have advanced since last session
- Determine what NPC actions have occurred off-screen
- Present consequences/new situations to player

**During Session:**
- Advance clocks only when explicit triggers are met
- Track which threads the player engages vs. ignores
- Update this file at session end with new statuses

**At Session End:**
- Mark threads as resolved, escalated, or dormant
- Update priority order based on player choices
- Advance independent clocks if time passed

---

## Session 08 Opening Context (Ready to Use)

**When starting Session 08, the DM should:**

1. **Present current situation:**
   - Luno has been classified as "Regulatory Actor" by Ashfall
   - Detained coordinator is in Brindlecross custody (interrogation opportunity)
   - Hobgoblin raids are increasing in frequency
   - Grayhaven merchants are nervous about trade stability

2. **Offer clear decision points:**
   - Interrogate coordinator now vs. delegate to Brindlecross
   - Hunt hobgoblin leaders vs. focus on Ashfall operations
   - Seek political allies (Grayhaven, magistrate) vs. operate independently
   - Research ARP/dragon vs. wait for them to reveal themselves

3. **Track player priorities:**
   - Which threats do they prioritize?
   - Which threads do they ignore (those advance independently)?
   - What resources do they allocate (time, gold, political capital)?

**Goal:** Present a living world where player choices matter but NPCs don't wait for permission to act.
