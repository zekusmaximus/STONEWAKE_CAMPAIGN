# DM Safety Checklist (Pre-Commit)
Run this checklist before committing any update.

## Canon integrity
- No edits that rewrite history.
- Contradictions resolved via Errata only.
- All unknowns labeled **Unknown (Canon gap)**.

## Mechanical correctness
- HP, spell slots, class features, and consumables updated correctly.
- Initiative, action economy, and RAW constraints upheld.

## Companion and NPC balance
- No stealth buffs to companions.
- Magic item rarity and attunement limits respected.
- NPCs/companions have clear resource tracking.

## Clocks
- Every tick has a clear trigger and session tie-in.
- Threshold outcomes noted when crossed.
- No reductions without a listed counter-action.

## Knowledge propagation
- NPC awareness updated consistently with events.
- World state reflects who learned what and when.

## Safety fallback
- If uncertain, append Errata instead of editing past canon.
