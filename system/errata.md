# Errata Index (Append-Only)
This file is a central index of Errata entries across the repo. It does not replace per-file Errata sections; it points to them.

## How to use
- When you add Errata to a file, append an entry here pointing to that file and session/date.
- Do not edit or remove prior entries.

## Errata Entries
- No entries yet.
