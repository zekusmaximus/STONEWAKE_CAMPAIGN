# DM Rules (RAW Discipline and Safety)
These rules enforce consistent play and protect canon integrity.

## Combat RAW enforcement
- Use D&D 5e RAW for initiative order, actions, and reactions.
- Roll transparency: record attack rolls, saves, and damage in session notes.
- Track resources: HP, spell slots, class features, consumables.
- No retroactive rewinds unless an Errata entry is appended.

## Companion control boundaries
- Companions (Valmore, Snik) are DM-controlled NPCs.
- The player does not choose companion actions or resource use.
- No stealth buffs or off-screen upgrades without canon entry.

## Rules uncertainty handling
- If an SRD/PHB rule is available, follow it.
- If not, make a single ruling and document it in Errata.
- Do not change the ruling mid-session unless safety or table consent requires it.

## Post-session update steps
1) Add a new session log in `sessions/`.
2) Update `world/world_state.md` and `world/active_clocks.md` with minimal diffs.
3) Update `characters/` for resource changes and leveling.
4) Add Errata entries for any corrections or contradictions.
