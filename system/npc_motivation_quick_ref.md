## Active Adversaries

### Ashfall Exchange (Infernal Escrow Institution)

**What Makes Them Act:**
- Luno exposing internal arbitration structures
- Luno disrupting Ashfall client operations
- Public scandal involving Ashfall brand
- Direct violence in Ashfall-controlled spaces

**Tone:** Professional, patient, bureaucratic. No theatrical villainy—just processes and procedures that happen to be infernally backed.

**Key Quote:** *"We've classified you as a Regulatory Actor. This triggers clause 7(b) of our arbitration framework."*

## NPC Agency Guidelines for DM Agents

### When NPCs Act Independently
- **Between sessions:** NPCs pursue their goals based on established motivations.
- **During downtime:** Clocks advance; NPCs make moves that create new situations.
- **When the player is occupied elsewhere:** Other factions advance their agendas.

### When NPCs React to Luno
- **Immediate threats:** Fight/flight/negotiate based on competence and resources.
- **Strategic pressure:** Adapt tactics, seek allies, escalate to superiors.
- **Social interactions:** Pursue goals through negotiation, deception, or cooperation.

### NPC Competence Levels
- **Highly Competent:** Ashfall agents, Captain Kain, Magistrate Vos (adapt, plan, don't repeat mistakes)
- **Competent:** Garrison soldiers, mercenaries, contractors (follow doctrine, retreat when outmatched)
- **Desperate:** Hobgoblin remnants, detained coordinator (act irrationally when cornered)

## Quick Decision Matrix for DMs

**When Luno takes an action, ask:**

1. **Who knows about it?** (Information flow determines reactions)
2. **Whose goals does it threaten?** (Those NPCs will respond)
3. **Who can act on it immediately?** (Proximity and resources determine speed)
4. **What's the most logical NPC response?** (Competent NPCs don't act suicidally or theatrically)

**Example:**
- **Action:** Luno arrests an Ashfall client.
- **Who knows?** Client (immediately), Ashfall (within days), local officials (immediately).
- **Whose goals?** Threatens Ashfall (escalation), concerns Grayhaven (stability vs. law).
- **Who can act?** Ashfall (legal pressure), client's allies (retaliation/rescue), officials (oversight).
- **Response:** Ashfall advances Clock 1 (+1), sends Caldris to "discuss jurisdiction," client's allies consider options.

## Final Notes for DM Agents

**NPCs are not obstacles—they're actors with goals.** Use this file to:
- Drive scenes when the player is deciding
- Advance clocks based on NPC actions, not arbitrary timing
- Create genuine choices (NPCs make credible threats and offers)
- Maintain consistency (NPCs remember past interactions and adapt)

**When in doubt:** Ask "What would a competent, self-interested person with this goal do right now?"
