# Conflict Resolution Procedures (Canon)

*This file provides DM agents with explicit guidance for resolving **non-combat conflicts** in the Stonewake campaign. Combat is a tool, not the default. This campaign prioritizes institutional, economic, and legal pressure.*

---

## Core Principle: Institutional Pressure Over Violence

**The Stonewake campaign operates on this hierarchy:**

1. **Economic Conflicts** (trade, contracts, asset control)
2. **Legal Conflicts** (jurisdiction, arbitration, formal charges)
3. **Institutional Conflicts** (reputation, political leverage, information control)
4. **Combat** (surgical, purposeful, serves strategic goals)

**Infernal agents, Ashfall, and the dragon-backed system prefer delegated enforcement and legal mechanisms.** They don't send assassins—they send lawyers with contracts and mercenaries with writs.

## Type 1: Economic Conflicts

### What They Look Like
- Trade embargoes or supply disruptions
- Contract manipulation or predatory terms
- Asset seizure or repossession
- Price controls or market manipulation
- Debt enforcement or credit denial

### How to Resolve Them

#### Player Tools
1. **Alternative Trade Routes:** Secure alternate supply lines to reduce dependency
2. **Contract Exposure:** Reveal predatory terms publicly to reduce signatories
3. **Asset Interdiction:** Seize goods/ledgers before they reach adversaries
4. **Economic Coalitions:** Unite merchants/towns against monopolistic pressure
5. **Legal Challenges:** Use magistrates to invalidate unfair contracts

#### NPC Tools
1. **Ashfall:** Offer "stability contracts" with hidden binding clauses
2. **Dragon Guarantor:** Provide impossible credit lines to undercut competitors
3. **Asset Resolution Partners:** Enforce contract terms via legal repossession
4. **Grayhaven Merchants:** Pressure officials to accept Ashfall terms
5. **Hobgoblins:** Raid supply lines to destabilize trade further

#### Resolution Mechanics
- **Success = player disrupts adversary economic goals or secures alternatives**
- **Failure = adversary locks in economic dominance (contracts signed, monopolies established)**
- **Partial = both sides secure positions; economic cold war continues**

#### Example Scenario
**Conflict:** Ashfall offers Grayhaven merchants a "trade stabilization contract" with predatory arbitration clauses.

**Player Options:**
1. Expose contract terms publicly (Persuasion check, access to magistrate)
2. Secure alternative trade route (Logistics, negotiation with Brindlecross)
3. Intimidate merchants into refusing (Intimidation check, risk reputation damage)
4. Sabotage Ashfall's reputation (Plant evidence of contract abuse, Investigation + Deception)

**Clock Impact:** Success reduces Grayhaven Stability clock; failure advances it (+1).

---

## Type 2: Legal Conflicts

### What They Look Like
- Arbitration disputes or appeals
- Jurisdiction challenges (who has authority?)
- Formal charges or subpoenas
- Audit traps or documentation warfare
- Contract enforcement or annulment

### How to Resolve Them

#### Player Tools
1. **Writ of Road Authority:** Legal cover for arrests and interdictions (Brindlecross-issued)
2. **Magistrate Support:** Elen Vos provides legal interpretation and jurisdictional guidance
3. **Clean Documentation:** Maintain paper trails to resist audit traps
4. **Formal Oversight:** Request official witnesses for arrests to establish legitimacy
5. **Contract Analysis:** Identify loopholes or invalidation conditions in infernal contracts

#### NPC Tools
1. **Ashfall:** Deploy subpoenas, charter challenges, jurisdictional disputes
2. **Asset Resolution Partners:** Operate in jurisdictional gray zones with legal cover
3. **Grayhaven Officials:** Use bureaucratic procedures to delay or deny actions
4. **Brindlecross:** Provide legal cover but require clean operations
5. **Infernal Adjunct:** Enforce contract terms via arbitration authority

#### Resolution Mechanics
- **Success = player establishes legal authority or invalidates adversary claims**
- **Failure = player loses legal standing or faces formal sanctions**
- **Partial = legal stalemate; both sides maneuver for advantage**

#### Example Scenario
**Conflict:** Ashfall issues a subpoena challenging Luno's Writ of Road Authority after he arrests an Ashfall client.

**Player Options:**
1. Request magistrate review (Persuasion check with Elen Vos; establishes writ validity)
2. Provide clean documentation of arrest (Investigation check; proves lawful grounds)
3. Challenge Ashfall's jurisdiction (Persuasion/Intimidation; argues they lack regional authority)
4. Ignore subpoena and dare escalation (Risk: advances Ashfall Escalation clock +1)

**Clock Impact:** Success maintains Brindlecross Legitimacy; failure advances Ashfall Escalation (+1).

---

## Type 3: Institutional Conflicts

### What They Look Like
- Reputation damage or propaganda
- Factional alignment (who supports whom?)
- Information control (exposing secrets, controlling narratives)
- Political leverage (bribes, favors, obligations)
- Surveillance and classification (Ashfall's "Regulatory Actor" label)

### How to Resolve Them

#### Player Tools
1. **Publicize Lawful Wins:** Expose successful arrests, recovered cargo, dismantled conspiracies
2. **Counter-Propaganda:** Frame Ashfall as predatory, infernal, exploitative
3. **Build Coalitions:** Align Grayhaven, Brindlecross, and merchants against Ashfall
4. **Information Warfare:** Plant misinformation, expose Ashfall's arbitration structure
5. **Reputation Management:** Maintain Brindlecross legitimacy via clean operations

#### NPC Tools
1. **Ashfall:** Classify Luno as "Regulatory Actor" (enables surveillance, containment)
2. **Deputy Chancellor Merrow:** Prioritize stability over justice (may resist Luno's actions)
3. **Captain Kain:** Provide support but require plausible deniability
4. **Hobgoblin Remnants:** Create chaos that makes Luno look ineffective
5. **Dragon Guarantor:** Shape "stability narratives" that favor Ashfall dominance

#### Resolution Mechanics
- **Success = player shapes public perception, secures allies, disrupts adversary narratives**
- **Failure = player loses political support, appears destabilizing or rogue**
- **Partial = contested narratives; both sides have supporters**

#### Example Scenario
**Conflict:** Grayhaven merchants view Luno's actions as destabilizing; some consider Ashfall contracts as "safer."

**Player Options:**
1. Publicize detained coordinator's confession (Persuasion check; exposes consortium crimes)
2. Secure trade route wins (Successful escort missions; demonstrates competence)
3. Expose Ashfall contract terms (Investigation + Persuasion; reveals hidden dangers)
4. Build coalition with Magistrate Vos and Captain Kain (Social maneuvering; creates unified front)

**Clock Impact:** Success reduces Grayhaven Stability clock; failure advances it (+1).

## Type 4: Combat (Surgical, Not Default)

### When Combat is Appropriate
- **Diplomacy has failed or is impossible** (hostile forces, no negotiation leverage)
- **Immediate tactical objectives** (capture targets, interdict operations, decapitate leadership)
- **Violence serves strategic goals** (intimidation, demonstration of capability, removing threats)
- **Adversary uses violence first** (self-defense, protecting assets)

### When Combat is NOT Appropriate
- **Institutional pressure is available** (legal, economic, political tools exist)
- **Violence undermines goals** (advances Brindlecross Legitimacy clock, creates martyrs)
- **Target is protected by legal/social structures** (killing in public, targeting officials)
- **Adversary wants violent escalation** (Ashfall benefits from Luno appearing rogue)

### Combat Resolution Mechanics
- **Use D&D 5e RAW:** Initiative, attack rolls, damage, saves
- **Track resources:** HP, spell slots, abilities, reactions, concentration
- **Record rolls:** Log all consequential rolls in session notes
- **Apply consequences:** XP, clock ticks, NPC reactions, reputation shifts

### Infernal Agent Combat Doctrine
**Ashfall and infernal entities avoid direct combat.** They prefer:
1. **Delegated enforcement:** Asset Resolution Partners, mercenaries, proxies
2. **Legal violence:** Repossessions, arrests, contract enforcement with armed backup
3. **Ambush and control:** Never fair fights; always overwhelming force or legal cover
4. **Retreat when outmatched:** Infernal agents are patient; they'll return with better terms

### Example Scenario
**Conflict:** Asset Resolution Partners attempt to "repossess" cargo from a Grayhaven merchant under Ashfall contract.

**Player Options (Escalation Ladder):**
1. **Legal Intervention:** Challenge contract validity (no combat; Persuasion/Intimidation)
2. **Physical Blockade:** Prevent repossession without violence (Athletics/Intimidation)
3. **Armed Standoff:** Threaten force if they proceed (Intimidation; may trigger combat)
4. **Combat:** Engage ARP mercenaries (initiative, tactical combat, arrest or kill)

**Clock Impact:**
- Legal/physical blockade success: No clock impact (clean resolution)
- Armed standoff success: Ashfall Escalation +1 (demonstrates force)
- Combat with witnesses: Brindlecross Legitimacy +1 (irregular violence)
- Combat without witnesses: No legitimacy impact (deniable)

---

## Conflict Escalation Ladder (General Guidance)

Use this ladder when conflicts arise:

### Step 1: Information & Positioning
- **Gather intel:** Who's involved? What do they want? What's at stake?
- **Assess leverage:** What tools (economic, legal, social, violent) are available?
- **Position strategically:** Secure advantages (allies, documentation, terrain)

### Step 2: Non-Violent Pressure
- **Economic:** Disrupt supply, offer alternatives, expose costs
- **Legal:** Challenge jurisdiction, demand oversight, use writs
- **Social:** Build coalitions, control narratives, leverage reputation

### Step 3: Threats & Intimidation
- **Demonstrate capability:** Show force without using it
- **Issue ultimatums:** Clear consequences if adversary proceeds
- **Controlled escalation:** Increase pressure incrementally

### Step 4: Surgical Violence
- **Isolated engagement:** No witnesses, deniable, tactical objectives
- **Capture over kill:** Prisoners provide intel and legitimacy
- **Clean documentation:** Justify violence legally (self-defense, lawful arrest)

### Step 5: Open Conflict
- **Last resort:** All other tools exhausted or ineffective
- **Strategic necessity:** Violence serves clear campaign goals
- **Accept consequences:** Clock ticks, reputation damage, NPC reactions

## Special Case: Infernal Contract Conflicts

### How Infernal Contracts Work in Stonewake
- **Binding clauses:** Once signed, contracts are magically enforceable
- **Hellsbind consequences:** Breaking contracts triggers penalties (pain, servitude, death)
- **Arbitration authority:** Disputes escalate to infernal adjudicators (delegated to guarantor)
- **Loopholes exist:** Contracts can be invalidated via specific conditions

### Resolving Infernal Contract Conflicts

#### Player Tools
1. **Contract Analysis:** Identify invalidation clauses (Investigation, Arcana, legal expertise)
2. **Force Majeure:** Create conditions that make performance impossible (economic disruption)
3. **Jurisdictional Challenge:** Argue infernal contracts lack mortal legal standing (magistrate support)
4. **Witness Coercion:** Prove contracts were signed under duress/deception (Investigation + Persuasion)
5. **Arbitration Manipulation:** Exploit arbitration structure (appeal to guarantor, expose delegation flaws)

#### NPC Tools
1. **Ashfall:** Enforce contracts via ARP proxies; escalate to guarantor if challenged
2. **Regional Coordinator:** Fears Hellsbind activation; will cooperate to avoid breach
3. **Infernal Adjunct:** Enforce arbitration rulings with clinical precision
4. **Dragon Guarantor:** Final arbitration authority; can override or enforce at will

#### Resolution Mechanics
- **Success = contract invalidated or adversary bound by unfavorable terms**
- **Failure = contract enforced; adversary gains leverage or player bound**
- **Partial = contract modified; both sides concede terms**

#### Example Scenario
**Conflict:** Detained coordinator has Hellsbind contract preventing full disclosure.

**Player Options:**
1. Offer protection from Ashfall (Persuasion; argues contract is void if signer is protected)
2. Identify invalidation clause (Investigation; finds "duress" or "misrepresentation" clause)
3. Force breach and document consequences (High-risk; proves contract is enforceable)
4. Bypass contract via indirect questions (Insight + Persuasion; gets intel without triggering clauses)

**Clock Impact:** Success provides intel on ARP/guarantor; failure alerts Ashfall to detention.

## DM Agent Decision Matrix

**When a conflict arises, ask:**

1. **What type of conflict is this?** (Economic, legal, institutional, combat)
2. **What tools does the player have?** (Writs, allies, gold, violence)
3. **What tools does the adversary have?** (Contracts, mercenaries, reputation, legal cover)
4. **What's the escalation ladder?** (Can this be resolved without violence?)
5. **What are the consequences?** (Which clocks advance? What NPCs react?)

**Default to lower escalation rungs.** Combat should feel like a deliberate choice, not the only option.

## Examples from Campaign History

### Example 1: Harrowfen Mill Sabotage (Session 4)
**Conflict Type:** Economic + Covert
**Player Approach:** Sabotaged ledgers/seals to force audit failures
**Escalation Level:** Step 2 (non-violent pressure)
**Outcome:** Disrupted consortium operations without combat; no clock ticks
**Lesson:** Covert economic warfare avoided violence and maintained legitimacy

### Example 2: Redwillow Crossing Arrest (Session 6)
**Conflict Type:** Legal + Combat (Hybrid)
**Player Approach:** Coordinated lawful arrest with Brindlecross; used writ authority
**Escalation Level:** Step 4 (surgical violence with legal cover)
**Outcome:** Node decapitated; legal documentation preserved legitimacy
**Lesson:** Violence backed by legal authority prevented Brindlecross Legitimacy clock tick

### Example 3: Ashfall Exchange Infiltration (Session 7)
**Conflict Type:** Institutional + Information
**Player Approach:** Requested arbitration access; gathered structural intel
**Escalation Level:** Step 1 (information gathering)
**Outcome:** Revealed delegated enforcement structure; triggered Ashfall classification
**Lesson:** Information warfare created strategic advantage at cost of surveillance

## Final Guidance for DM Agents

**This campaign rewards strategic thinking over brute force.**

- Present conflicts with multiple resolution paths (economic, legal, social, violent)
- Show consequences for each path (clock ticks, NPC reactions, resource costs)
- Respect player choices even if they choose violence (but show costs)
- NPCs use institutional tools first, violence last (except desperate hobgoblins)

**When in doubt:** Ask "What would a competent, self-interested adversary with institutional power do?" The answer is rarely "send assassins."
